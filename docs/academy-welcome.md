## TokenEngineering Academy

The TokenEngineering Academy offers lectures, workshops and seminars for everyone interested in this emerging engineering field and aiming to put it into practice.  
Please find below our current program including details on the course agenda, timelines, registrations and costs.
If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to [contact us](a.kreitenweis@conectopia.io).

## Introduction to Token Engineering

This two hours session provides an introduction to Token Engieering. It covers the following topics:
- Engineering Ethics
- Foundations of the discipline
- Design goals and steps in the Token Engineering Process
- Practical application
- Becoming a token engineer
- Token Engineering community overview

**Level:** < **Beginner** / Advanced / Special Skills >  
**Process: < Ecosystem Design - Economic Mechanisms/Patterns - Modeling & Simulations - Implementation - Monitoring >**  
**Date:** July - further details tba, we'll offer this course on a monthly base  
**Location:** online/live  
**Fee:** free  
**Number of participants:** up to 20  
**Registration:** opens in July, further details tbd  


## Token Model Generation (Ecosystem Value Flows)

This interactive online course picks up where "[Business Model Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas#cite_note-Osterwalder2010-3)" ends. The first phase consists of analyzing and specifying the value network of organizations and individuals to be tokenized. We start with [canvases](https://github.com/villeeloranta/ecosystem-design-toolkit) that are familiar to business/product architects, with adaptations to help us focus on motivations in order to analyze value flows and as inputs for icentive [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). The description of the value network is then carried out in a visual language similar to [stock & flows](https://systemic2016.wordpress.com/system-dynamics-stock-and-flow-modelling/). The course has the following structure:

- Day 1: Ecosystem Purpose & Members
- Day 2: Stakeholder Stories & Motives
- Day 3: Value Flows & Constraints
- Day 4: Value Network Specification

With this output, you will be ready for the next phases of Token Model Generation: applying existing cryptoeconomic patterns, adaptations, and new mechanisms. You or your technical counterpart can then specify the dynamic model further using [Differential Specification Syntax](https://community.cadcad.org/t/differential-specification-syntax-key/31) and simulate using [cadCAD](https://cadcad.org/). If you are not familiar with systems modeling and systems dynamics, this course is a prerequisite.
